# Horiseon code refactor

## Description

This project is the first assignment from the bootcamp. Presumably I work in a marketing agency and I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

- I have learned to create semantic tags and add atributes to the images and icons.
- I have also condensed the css code to have it better organised and follow the scout rule. 
- I have checked that HTML & CSS elements follow a logical structure.


Now the users with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Also the web should be better positioned in search engines like Google. And will help the company to avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
